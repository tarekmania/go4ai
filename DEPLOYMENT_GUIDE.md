# Hostpoint Deployment Guide for go4ai

## Overview
This guide explains how to deploy the Scheduler Link Finder application to Hostpoint hosting.

## Files Ready for Deployment
All necessary files are located in the `dist/` folder and are ready for upload to Hostpoint.

### Required Files Structure:
```
dist/
├── index.html              # Main HTML file
├── .htaccess               # Apache configuration for client-side routing
├── favicon.ico             # Website icon
├── placeholder.svg         # Placeholder image
├── robots.txt              # Search engine instructions
└── assets/
    ├── index-B5DBplWk.css  # Compiled CSS styles
    └── index-C2F3czzb.js   # Compiled JavaScript bundle
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Upload Files to Hostpoint
1. Connect to your Hostpoint hosting via FTP/SFTP or File Manager
2. Navigate to your domain's public folder (usually `public_html` or `www`)
3. Upload ALL contents of the `dist/` folder to the root of your web directory
4. Ensure the `.htaccess` file is uploaded (it may be hidden by default)

### 2. Verify File Permissions
- Ensure all files have proper read permissions (644 for files, 755 for directories)
- The `.htaccess` file should have 644 permissions

### 3. Test the Deployment
1. Visit your domain in a web browser
2. Test navigation between different sections of the app
3. Verify that direct URL access works (e.g., refreshing the page on any route)

## Technical Details

### Client-Side Routing
The `.htaccess` file handles React Router's client-side routing by:
- Redirecting all non-file requests to `index.html`
- Allowing React Router to handle the routing on the client side

### Performance Optimizations
The deployment includes:
- Gzip compression for text files
- Cache headers for static assets (1 year cache)
- Security headers for enhanced protection

### File Sizes
- CSS: 60.09 kB (10.77 kB gzipped)
- JavaScript: 369.68 kB (117.28 kB gzipped)
- Total bundle size is optimized for web delivery

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **404 errors on page refresh**: Ensure `.htaccess` file is uploaded and mod_rewrite is enabled
2. **Styles not loading**: Check that CSS file paths are correct and files are uploaded
3. **JavaScript errors**: Verify all files in the `assets/` folder are uploaded

### Hostpoint Specific Notes:
- Hostpoint supports Apache with mod_rewrite enabled
- The `.htaccess` configuration should work out of the box
- If you encounter issues, contact Hostpoint support to verify mod_rewrite is enabled

## Application Features
The deployed application includes:
- Scheduler Link Finder for finding Calendly links
- Professional interface for investor outreach
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Privacy-respectful search functionality
